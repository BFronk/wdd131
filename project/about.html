    <h1 id="about-intro">About this site</h1>
    <p id="about-text"> Some of my best memberies were with awesome roller coasters. My first big 
        coaster was wicked at Lagoon and that's when they just fell in love. I 
        had similar moments on talk to an Iron Gwazi where i'll just remember 
        them forever because of how much fun I had and how much they suprised 
        me. I also get excited about innovation in the rollercoaster space. 
        Take pipeline, at SeaWorld Orlando. This coaster is a next generation
        stand-up that is just a blast. It offers some of the most unique airtime 
        I've ever experienced. There's nothing else like it in the world and for 
        a prototype, or first of its kind it is absolutely mind blowing. I look 
        forward to going on a lot more and broadening my horizons because there's 
        still much more that I need to experience, but I don't see my love for 
        them stopping ant time soon.
